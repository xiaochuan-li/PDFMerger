# PDFMerger
This project is for the purpose of merging PDFs into one single file using a user-friendly GUI without any limitation on file size or numbers or others, and as it works totally offline, there is no worry about information leaking. 


Requirments

`PyQt5` and `QCandyUi` as well as `PyPDF2` are needed, all of which could be installed by running `pip install some-packages`.
